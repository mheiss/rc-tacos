CONFIGURATION |
--------------
This documentation will guide you through the required configuration so that you will be able 
to launch the application locally.

Server-Adapter: (Tomcat 6.x) 
----------------------------
First of all you have to define the runtime of the web project. Currently the web-project is configured 
to use Apache Tomcat 6.x as target runtime.  

So create a new "Server" using the Eclipse Wizard:
    File -> New -> Server -> Apache -> Tomcat 6.0
Follow the instructions to configure the server server. 

Tell Eclipse to compile all projects using 
    Project -> CleanAll

After the configuration of the server adapter all projects in your workspace should compile without
any errors. If you have compile errors check the build-path for unbound Libraries and missing Builders.

Configuration:
--------------
The project requires two mandatory configuration files that have to be provided. For both files
templates are checked-in as sample configuration.

    Log4j:  at.redcross.tacos.logging
            Copy src/log4j.properties.example to src/log4j.properties

    JPA:    at.redcross.tacos.dbal
            Copy src/META-INF/persistence.xml.example to src/META-INF/persistence.xml

The provided templates contain a meaningful default configuration that should be a good starting point.
