PREPARE-PROJECTS |
=================
The target of this documentation is to describe how to get the projects from SVN to start developing.
We provide a so called TeamProjectSet to quickly checkout the required projects code from SVN. 

The latest file is available in SVN and can be downloaded using the following URL:
    http://rc-tacos.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/rc-tacos/development/Tacos_trunk.psf?revision=3715

Save a copy of this file on your local hard drive and then import it using the import manager of Eclipse:
    File -> Import -> Team -> Team Project Set.

Now the referenced projects will be checked-out into your workspace. 

ECLIPSE-CONFIGURATION
---------------------
To ensure that all Java-Code from different developers is formatted the same way we provide
a Code-Formatter template. The formatter is in the workspace under development/TacosCodeFormatter.xml

Tell eclipse to use this formatter using:
    Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Code Style -> Formatter -> Import

Now proceed to the next step to get rid of the compile errors :)
