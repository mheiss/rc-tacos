REPORTING - ENGINE |
--------------------
This readme file will guide you through the deployment of the BIRT-Reporting engine so that you will be able to 
create PDF reports using the web application.

1) Download "Latest BIRT Runtime Release" (2.5.x)" to a local directory:
   RUNTIME: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/birt/downloads/drops/R-R1-2_5_2-201002221500/birt-runtime-2_5_2.zip
   
2) Extract "birt-runtime-2_5_x.zip" to a local directory

3) Navigate to the ReportEngine sub-directory 

4) Copy the two folders 'plugins' and 'configuration' to the 'at.redcross-tacos-web/WebContent/WEB-INF/platform' directory.

5) The resulting file system structure should look like

   at.redcross-tacos-web
   |
   -  WebContent
      |
      - WEB-INF
        |
        - platform
          |
          - configuration
          - plugins
          
6) Start or Restart the web application and you are ready to create your first report :)
