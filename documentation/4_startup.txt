STARTUP |
--------
In order to use the application you have to create two different launch configuration.

Tomcat 6.x
-----------
Use the eclipse launch manager to create a default configuration. No specialized
configuration has to be done.

Database
--------
To increment the local development speed it is highly recommended to use the provided
HSQL-DB instance. So you do NOT need to install any third party database like MS-SQL-Server.
When you want to use a third-party database provider then you have to change the 'persistence.xml' configuration.

Create a new Java launch configuration using the launch manager of eclipse and configure it 
to use the following settings:

	Java-Launch-Configuration "Main" Tab:
       Project:      at.redcross.tacos.hsqldb
       Main-Class:  at.redcross.tacos.hsqldb.HsqlServer

The database files and tables are stored in 'at.redcross.tacos.hsqldb/database' and will be created automatically.
Now you are ready to launch both applications. :)
